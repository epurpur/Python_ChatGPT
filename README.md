# Python & ChatGPT
This workshop is meant to show you various ways you can potentially use the power of Generative AI to complement your programming in python to become more efficient, troubleshoot errors, learn more about weak points, and automate tedious or annoying tasks.

I'm a part of a group called [research data services](https://data.library.virginia.edu/) and I do these things:
    
    1. Serve as Liaison to various departments in the sciences & engineering
    2. Teach workshops and classes (like this one)
    3. Help people with research projects
    4. Random other things as they come up

## Generative AI background 
Generative artificial intelligence refers to a class of artificial intelligence models that have the ability to generate new content such as text, images, audio, or other types of data. These models are trained on large datasets and learn to understand patterns and structures within the data, allowing them to create new content.

One prominent example of generative AI is the GPT model (Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) which is a type of transformer architecture developed by OpenAI. GPT models are capable of generating human-like text based on the input they receive. They have been used in various applications including natural language processing, content creation, language translation, etc. Large language models, like GPT, are pre-trained on vast datasets in order to understand human-like langage patterns. Pre-Training means that massive datasets are fed into the language model containing diverse examples of human language. During this phase, the model learns to predict the next word in a sentence based on the context of the preceding words. This process helps the model capture the nuances of human language.

## Caveat - Don't Trust AI Blindly!

**From ChatGPT itself...**
While GPT and similar language models are powerful, there are situations where you should be cautious and not rely solely on their generated content. Situations you should not rely on generative AI include
  - factual information: GPT may not always provide accurate or up to date information. It doesn't have real-time awareness and may generate content based on outdated data or misconceptions. Verify critical information from reliable sources
  - Biases: GPT can inadvertently perpetuate biases present in its training data. Be cautious when relying on the model for sensitive or controversial topics.
  - Legal Matters: Content generated by GPT may not comply with legal or regulatory standards. Avoid relying on the model for legal, compliance, or domain expertise without consulting professionals.
  - Sensitive Personal or Confidential Information: Avoid inputing sensitive personal information into the model. GPT does not guarantee privacy.
  - Critical Decision-Making: For important decisions with consequences, human expertise should take priority.
  - Emotional or ethical considerations: GPT does not possess real emotions or ethical reasoning.
  - Technical Experise: For highly specialized or technical fields, GPT may not have the domain expertise.

To summarize, while generative AI is good for a lot of things, it is not perfect and it can be tricky to know when to use it versus when not to use it. In the rest of the workshop we will look at some use cases that I tend to use gen AI for when it comes to writing code in python. 

## ChatGPT 3 vs ChatGPT 4
**In this workshop we will be using ChatGPT 3.5**. At the time of creating this workshops, this is the free version of the software. There are various paid tiers of service which upgrade the model available. I wanted to make this content accessible to all for free. ChatGPT 4 has improved functionality and if you choose, you are welcome to subscribe to it. 

## Use Cases in this workshop

- start from a blank canvas
- specialized libraries like pandas and selenium
- writing comments and documentation
- regular expressions decoding
- convert from one language to another
- follow up on things you don't understand
- deconstructing error messages
- optimization
